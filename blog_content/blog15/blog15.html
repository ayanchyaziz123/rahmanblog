  <h1>Understanding Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming</h1>

  <h2>What is Polymorphism?</h2>
  <p>
    Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The term polymorphism means "many shapes" and it enables a single interface to be used for different data types or objects.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Polymorphism</h2>
  <p>
    There are two main types of polymorphism:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism):</strong> This type is achieved through method overloading and operator overloading. The method to be invoked is determined at compile time.</li>
      <li><strong>Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism):</strong> This type is achieved through method overriding. The method to be invoked is determined at runtime, which is usually implemented using inheritance and virtual functions.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Why is Polymorphism Important?</h2>
  <p>
    Polymorphism is important for several reasons:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> It allows code to be written in a more generic manner, thus reducing redundancy and increasing reusability.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> It enables the same function or method to behave differently based on the object or data type, making the system more flexible and scalable.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Polymorphic code can be easier to maintain because changes can be made in one place, and the changes will be reflected across the application.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Examples of Polymorphism</h2>

  <div class="code-container">
    <h3>Example: Compile-time Polymorphism in Python</h3>
    <pre><code># Python code to demonstrate compile-time polymorphism using method overloading

class MathOperations:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def add(self, a, b, c):
        return a + b + c

math_ops = MathOperations()
print("Sum of two numbers:", math_ops.add(5, 10))  # Outputs: Sum of two numbers: 15
print("Sum of three numbers:", math_ops.add(5, 10, 15))  # Outputs: Sum of three numbers: 30
    </code></pre>
  </div>

  <div class="code-container">
    <h3>Example: Runtime Polymorphism in Python</h3>
    <pre><code># Python code to demonstrate runtime polymorphism using method overriding

class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

def print_animal_sound(animal):
    print(animal.make_sound())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

print_animal_sound(dog)  # Outputs: Woof!
print_animal_sound(cat)  # Outputs: Meow!
    </code></pre>
  </div>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Polymorphism is a powerful concept in object-oriented programming that enhances flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of code. By allowing different objects to be treated as instances of a common superclass, polymorphism enables developers to write more generic and adaptable code, which is essential for building robust and scalable applications.
