        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The night sky has always been a source of wonder for me. From a young age, I was fascinated by the stars, planets, and the mysteries of the universe. This curiosity led me to study astronomy as a hobby and coding as a profession.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            To me, coding is like exploring the universe. Both require problem-solving, creativity, and an unending quest for knowledge. Whether Iâ€™m writing code to solve a complex problem or gazing through a telescope to find a distant galaxy, the thrill of discovery is what drives me.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Through this blog, I want to share how these two seemingly different fields are interconnected in my life and how they can inspire innovation and exploration in both science and technology.
